/*
 * What's this file?
 * It's a dictionary of quest abbreviations we like to use. It maps abbreviations to quest descriptions.
 *
 * Why do one abbreviation map to multiple 'actions' and 'rewards'?
 * All the action or reward strings under one abbreviation is supposed to mean one unique actions. The multiple strings
 * are to support different descriptions of the same thing. For example, some say "Throw 3 Great Ball in A Row" while
 * some says "Make 3 Great Throws in a row". And some mapping website in Japan will call it something in Japanese. These
 * arrays are suppose to hold all possible action/reward descriptions.
 *
 * Does order matter for the 'actions' or 'rewards' arrays?
 * Yes - the first string in each of these arrays is used to generate the outputs that users see. Subsequent array
 * elements are assumed to be other known representations of the same thing that are used when reading maps from
 * different sources.
 * Example:
 * "3G15": {
 *     "actions": ["Make 3 Great Curveball Throws in a row", "Throw 3 Great Curveballs in A Row"],
 *     "rewards": ["1500 Stardust"]
 * },
 * Output will use "Make 3 Great Curveball Throws in a row" to describe "3G15". But when a quest extractor comes across
 * "Throw 3 Great Curveballs in A Row", it will know that means the same thing as "Make 3 Great Curveball Throws in a
 * row".
 *
 * Some assumption about quest/action/reward descriptions:
 *  - Abbreviation uniquely identify an action-reward pair, i.e. '3G10' refers to one action and reward only
 *  - Action description strings are unique, i.g. 'Win 3 Gym Battles' cannot mean different action in different language
 *  - Reward description strings are unique, i.g. '1000 Stardust' cannot mean different things in different language
 *
 * TODO: Move multiple description language support business out of the abbreviation dictionary. Technically, we may
 * want to define these translations without having to define an abbreviation for the quest. Translation functionality
 * may find a better home somewhere under pogo.assistance.data.extraction.
